<h3>ABRAHAM LINCOLN</h3>

<h4>AND THE</h4>

<h3>LONDON PUNCH</h3>


<p>"Tell me what a man laughs at, and I will tell
you what he is," was one of Goethe's pregnant apothegms.</p>

<p>Laughter, one of the chief lines of cleavage
between man and beast, is one of the chief points
of differentiation between man and man. From
the good-natured banter which kins all the world
to the envenomed sneer that sunders it, laughter
runs the whole gamut of human emotions.</p>

<p>It is always sincere, even in its own despite.
No subterfuge, when subterfuge underlies it, is
more easily unmasked. A man may smile and
smile and be a villain, but villainy by the seeing
eye can be infallibly detected beneath the smile.</p>

<p>A counterfeit laugh may be uttered, as counterfeit
coin is uttered, but it does not ring true. Its
baseness reveals itself to more senses than one.</p>

<p>Now for more than sixty years the recognized
organ of British laughter has been the London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n12">[12]</a></span>
<i>Punch</i>. The contemporary mood of John Bull
towards Brother Jonathan has always voiced
itself through the grinning lips of this chartered
jester.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that even before the outbreak
of the Civil War <i>Punch</i> had shown itself friendly
to America or Americans. Why should it? The
British mob disliked us and flouted us. <i>Punch</i>
as the mouthpiece of the mob, followed suit. In
the original prospectus of that journal, issued in
1845, it was expressly announced that the paper
was to be devoted in part to "Yankee yarns," to
"the naturalization of those alien Jonathans
whose adherence to the truth has forced them to
emigrate from their native land." It would appear
from this new crook-backed Daniel come
to judgment, that Ananias and Autolycus were
models of punctilious honesty and meticulous
truthfulness compared with the average American.</p>

<p>Writing from Boston to Sir Edward Head, in
1854, George Ticknor said: "I am much struck
with what you say about the ignorance that prevails
in England, concerning this country and its
institutions, and the mischief likely to spring from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n14">[14]</a></span>
it. From <i>Punch</i> up to your leading statesmen,
things are constantly said and done out of sheer
misapprehension, or ignorance, that have for
some time been breeding ill-will here, and are
likely to breed more."</p>

<p>Up to, and even immediately after the war,
<i>Punch's</i> sympathies professedly leaned towards
the North, though it took occasion to lecture both
sides from the standpoint of a disinterested and
superior friend, who saw that neither side was
absolutely and unconditionally right.</p>

<p>When the news of the secession of South Carolina reached England, in
January, 1861, John Tenniel contributed a cartoon to the jester's pages
entitled: "Divorce a Vinculo" with the explanatory subtitle "Mrs.
Carolina asserts her rights to 'larrup' her nigger." Mrs. Carolina was
represented as a vulgar virago holding a cat-o-nine tails in her right
hand, and shaking her clenched left fist in the face of a serenely
defiant youth, clad in a star-spangled shirt, to whom a little brat
of a nigger appealed with clasped hands.</p>

<p>In the same number the following poem breathed
a similar anti-secession sentiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="n16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">SECESSION AND SLAVERY</p>

<div style="margin-left: 30%; ">

<p>Secede, ye Southern States, secede,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No better plan could be,<br />
If you of niggers would be freed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set your niggers free.<br />
Runaway slaves by federal law<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present you reclaim;<br />
So from the Union straight withdraw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And play the Free Soil game.</p>

<p>What, when you've once the knot untied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will bind the Northern men?<br />
And who'll resign to your cow-hide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fugitives again?<br />
Absquatulate, then, slick as grease,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And break up unity,<br />
Or take your president in peace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eat your humble pie.</p>

<p>But if your stomachs proud disdain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That salutary meal<br />
And you, in passion worse than vain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must rend the commonweal,<br />
Then all mankind will jest and scoff<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At people in the case<br />
Of him that hastily cut off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His nose to spite his face.</p>

</div>

<p>Later, <i>Punch</i> applauded that portion of Abraham
Lincoln's first inaugural, which dealt with
the question of secession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="n18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE COMMINUTED STATES</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Who can say where Secession will stop? That is a question
which is raised by <span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln</span>, in a part of his inaugural
address, directed to enforce upon fools and madmen
the necessity of acquiescence by minorities in the decision
of majorities. The President tells the frantic portion of his
fellow countrymen that:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is no alternative for continuing the Government
but acquiescence on one side or the other. If a minority
in such a case will secede rather than acquiesce, they
make a precedent which in turn will ruin and divide them,
for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever
a majority refuses to be controlled by such a minority. For
instance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy, a
year or two hence, arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions
of the present Union now claim to secede from it?
All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated
to the exact temper of doing this."</p>

<p>The force of this simple reasoning will be seen by the
lunatics to whom it is addressed, during their lucid intervals,
if they have any. It may even be hoped that some of them
may recover the use of their reflecting faculties so far as to
be enabled to follow out <span class="smcap">President Lincoln's</span> argument,
and their own folly, into ultimate consequences and conclusions.
Then they will see what is likely to be the end of
Secession, for it is not quite true that there is no end to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n20">[20]</a></span>
Secession, and the end of Secession will be for the Secessionists
an end of everything. Seceders will go on seceding
and subseceding, until at last every citizen will secede from
every other citizen, and each individual will be a sovereign
state in himself, self-government personified, a walking
autonomy, a lone star, doing business and supporting itself
off its own hook.</p>
</div>

<p>When the seceding states were in search of a
name, <i>Punch</i> suggested that of Slaveownia, and
when at the convention held February 9, 1861,
at Montgomery, Alabama, they adopted the title of
the Confederate States of America, <i>Punch</i> reopened
his battery in this fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>"The Southern Secessionists must be admitted to be
blessed with at least the philosophical virtue of self-knowledge.
They term this new league the 'Confederate States
of America'; thus they call themselves by what they doubtless
feel to be their right name. They are confederates in
the crime of upholding slavery. A correct estimate of their
moral position is manifest in that distinctive denomination
of theirs, 'Confederate States.' This title is a beautiful
antithesis to that of the United States of America. The
more doggedly confederate slave mongers combine, the more
firmly good republicans should unite."</p>
</div>

<p>Once more when reviewing Jefferson Davis'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n22">[22]</a></span>
message to the Confederate Congress, <i>Punch</i>
recognized that slavery was really the bone of
contention between the two sections:</p>

<p class="center">THE JUST AND HOLY CAUSE OF SLAVERY</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>"<span class="smcap">We</span> feel," says <span class="smcap">President Jefferson Davis</span>, in his
Message to the Secessional Congress, "that our cause is
just and holy." Could not the negroes of the Southern
States, if they rose against their masters, say just as much,
with at least equal justice, for their own insurrection? The
less <span class="smcap">Mr Davis</span> says about justice and holiness the better,
if he does not want to preach a dangerous doctrine, besides
being considered a humbug. "Dash holiness, and justice
be blanked!" is the consistent language for <span class="smcap">Mr. Jefferson
Davis</span>. "Might is right; we expect to thrash the Northerners;
and the Institution of Slavery for ever!"</p>
</div>

<p>Again, when General Beauregard declared in a
proclamation to the South that "unborn generations
would arise and call them blessed," <i>Punch</i>
declared that the reporters, with their proverbial
inaccuracy, had omitted the concluding word
"rascals."</p>

<p>Yet even now, it appealed to both sections to
restrain their hands from flying at each other's
throats:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ODE TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH</p>

<div style="margin-left: 30%">

<p>O <span class="smcap">Jonathan</span> and <span class="smcap">Jefferson</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come listen to my song;<br />
I can't decide, my word upon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of you is most wrong.<br />
I do declare I am afraid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say which worse behaves,<br />
The North, imposing bonds on Trade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or South, that Man enslaves.</p>

<p>And here you are about to fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wage intestine war,<br />
Not either of you in the right:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What simpletons you are!<br />
Too late your madness you will see,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when your passion cools,<br />
"Snakes!" you will bellow, "How could we<br />

'Twill be apparent what a few<br />

Greatness and glory you'll have lost;<br />

<p>Oh, joined to us by blood, and by<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bond of kindred speech,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of slang, bound each to each,<br />
All-fired gonies, softhorn'd pair,<br />

You everlastin' dolts, forbear!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throw down your arms right slick.</p>

<p>You'll chaw each other up, you two,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like those Kilkenny cats,<br />
When they had better things to do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvin' off the rats.<br />
Now come, shake hands, together jog<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On friendly yet once more;<br />
Whip one another not: and flog<br />

<p>Still again, <i>Punch</i> showed good feeling in admonishing
Lord Palmerston, after firing on Sumter,
to keep Great Britain neutral.</p>

<p>"Well Pam," says Mr. Punch to his workman,
"of course I shall keep you on, but you must stick
to peace-work."</p>

<p>Nor could the North object to the cartoon, in
May, 1861, in which Lincoln made his first appearance
in <i>Punch</i>. The face, faithfully limned from
the early beardless photographs, represented him
as a man of clean-cut intelligent features,&mdash;in
marked contrast to the bearded ruffian, a repulsive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n28">[28]</a></span>
compound of malice, vulgarity and cunning
which John Tenniel's pencil subsequently delighted
to give to the world as a counterfeit presentment
of the President of the United States.</p>

<p>In this first picture Lincoln is represented as
poking the fire and filling the room with particles
of soot, saying with downcast look:</p>

<p>"What a nice White House it would be, if it
were not for the blacks."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the poem with which <i>Punch</i>
greeted the news of the fall of Fort Sumter was not
calculated to arouse kindly sentiments in the
North.</p>

<p class="center">INK, BLOOD AND TEARS</p>

<p class="center">(THE TAKING OF FORT SUMTER.)</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20%">

<p>A Forty hours' bombardment! Great guns throwing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their iron hail: shells their mad mines exploding:<br />
Furnaces lighted: shot at red-heat glowing:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shore-battr'ies and fort-armament, firing, loading&mdash;<br />
War's visible hell let loose for forty hours,<br />
And all her devils free to use their powers&mdash;<br />
And yet not one man hit, her flag when Sumter lowers.</p>

<p>"Oh, here's a theme!" quoth Punch, of brag abhorrent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Twixt promise and performance rare proportion!<br />
This show-cloth, of live lions, giving warrant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masking some mangy, stunted, stuffed abortion:<br />

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> always thought <span class="smcap">Jonathan</span>, his young brother,<br />

But in all change of chaff with one another,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor <span class="smcap">John</span> nor <span class="smcap">Jonathan</span> was e'er called 'laggard.'<br />
But now, if <span class="smcap">John</span> mayn't <span class="smcap">Jonathan</span> style 'coward,'<br />
He <i>may</i> hint Stripes and Stars were better lowered<br />
From that tall height to which, till now, their flag-staff towered."</p>

<p><i>Punch</i> nibbed his pen, all jubilant, for galling&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When suddenly a weight weighed down the feather,<br />
And a red liquid, drop by drop, slow falling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came from the nib; and the drops rolled together,<br />
And steamed and smoked and sung&mdash;"Not ink, but blood;<br />
Drops now, but soon to swell into a flood,<br />
Perchance e'er Summer's leaf has burst Spring's guarding bud.</p>

<p>Blood by a brother's hand drawn from a brother&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they by whom 'tis ta'en, by whom 'tis given,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n32">[32]</a></span>
Are both the children of an English mother;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once with that mother, in her wrath, they've striven:<br />
Was't not enough, that parricidal jar,<br />
But they must now meet in fraternal war?<br />
If such strife draw no blood shall England scoff therefore?</p>

<p>If she will laugh, through thee, her chartered wit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use thou no ink wherewith to pen thy scoff:<br />
We'll find a liquor for thy pen more fit&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We blood drops&mdash;see how smartly thou'lt round off<br />
Point, pun and paragraph in this new way:<br />
Till men shall read and laugh, and, laughing, say,<br />
'Well thrust! <i>Punch</i> is in vein: 'tis his red-letter day.'"</p>

<p>The weight sat on my quill: I could not write;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red drops lustered to my pen&mdash;in vain;<br />
I had my theme&mdash;"Brothers that meet in fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet shed no blood!"&mdash;my jesting mood turned pain.<br />
I thought of all that civil love endears,<br />
That civil strife breaks up and rends and sears,<br />
And lo! the blood-drops in my pen were changed to tears!</p>

<p>And for the hoarse tongues that those bloody gouts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had found, or seemed to find, upon my ears<br />
Came up a gentle song in linkèd bouts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of long-drawn sweetness&mdash;pity breathed through tears.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus they sang&mdash;"'Twas not by chance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still less by fraud or fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Sumter's battle came and closed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor cost the world a tear."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="n34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the Southern victory of Bull Run and the
Northern policy of blockade that finally and definitely
changed the attitude of England and of
<i>Punch</i>. The victory gave hopes that the Confederates
might be successful in overturning a
hated and dreaded republic; the blockade aroused
fears that the pocket of the British manufacturer
might be damaged. All pretence of love for the
negro was swallowed up by these more potent and
more personal emotions.</p>

<p>On November 2, 1861, in a cartoon and an
accompanying poem <i>Punch</i> sought to put its commercial
anxiety on an altruistic plane. Here
is the poem:</p>

<p class="center">KING COTTON BOUND; OR, THE NEW
PROMETHEUS.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 30%; ">

<p>Far across Atlantic waters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groans in chains a Giant King;<br />
Like to him, whom Ocean's daughters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wail around in mournful ring,<br />
In the grand old Grecian strains<br />
Of <span class="smcap">Prometheus</span> in his chains!</p>

<p>Needs but Fancy's pencil pliant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both to paint till both agree;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n36">[36]</a></span>
For King Cotton is a giant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As <span class="smcap">Prometheus</span> claimed to be.<br />
Each gave blessings unto men,<br />
Each dishonour reaped again.</p>

<p>From the gods to sons of clay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If <span class="smcap">Prometheus</span> brought the flame,<br />
Who King Cotton can gainsay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should he equal honour claim?<br />
Fire and life to millions giving,<br />
That, without him, had no living.</p>

<p>And if they are one in blessing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in suffering they are one;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freeze in frost and scorch in sun:<br />
That, upon his mountain chain,<br />
This, upon his parching plain.</p>

<p>Nor the wild bird's self is wanting&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either giant's torment sore;<br />
If <span class="smcap">Prometheus</span> writhed, while panting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart and lungs the vulture tore,<br />
So Columbia's eagle fierce,<br />
Doth King Cotton's vitals pierce.</p>

<p>On those wings so widely sweeping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its poise the bird to keep,<br />
See, if you can see for weeping.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"North" and "South" are branded deep&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n38">[38]</a></span>
On the beak all reeking red,<br />
On the talons blood-bespread!</p>

<p>But 'tis not so much the anguish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the wound that rends his side,<br />
Makes this fettered giant languish,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the thought how once, in pride,<br />
That great eagle took its stand,<br />
Gently on his giant hand!</p>

<p>How to it the meat he'd carry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its mew to feed secure;<br />
How he'd fling it on the quarry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How recall it to the lure,<br />
Make it stoop, to his caresses,<br />
Hooded neck and jingling jesses.</p>

<p>And another thought is pressing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like hot iron on his brain&mdash;<br />
Millions that would fain be blessing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ban, e'en now, King Cotton's name.<br />
Oh, that here those hands are bound,<br />
Which should scatter wealth around!</p>

<p>"Not this Eagle's screaming smothers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sad sound across the sea&mdash;<br />
Wailing babes and weeping mothers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wailing, weeping, wanting me.<br />
Hands that I would fain employ,<br />
Hearts that I would fill with joy!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="n40">[40]</a></span>

<p>"I must writhe&mdash;a giant fettered,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While those millions peak and pine;<br />
By my wealth their lot unbettered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their suffering worse than mine.<br />
For they know that I would fain<br />
Help their need, were't not my chain!</p>

<p>"But <i>I</i> know not where to turn me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For relief from bonds and woe;<br />
Frosts may pinch and suns may burn me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for rescue&mdash;none I know,<br />
Save the millions I have fed,<br />
Should they rise for lack of bread&mdash;</p>

<p>"Saying, 'We will brook no longer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That King Cotton bound should be:<br />
Be his gaolers strong, <i>we</i>'re stronger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our hunger o'er sea&mdash;<br />
More for want, than love, uprisen,<br />
We are come to break his prison!'</p>

<p>"Welcome even such releasing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fain my work I'd be about:<br />
Soon would want and wail be ceasing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were King Cotton once let out&mdash;<br />
Though all torn and faint and bleeding,<br />
Millions still I've strength for feeding."</p>
</div>

<p>Then came an episode which did for the moment
set John Bull and <i>Punch</i> on a nobler basis. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n42">[42]</a></span>
during the Trent affair&mdash;when the United States
was obviously wrong in arresting the Confederate
Commissioners, Mason and Slidell, on board an
English ship&mdash;the Tenniel cartoons rose to the
higher level of just indignation.</p>

<p>Even now, however, <i>Punch</i> was unable or unwilling
to see the magnanimity of Abraham Lincoln's
apology for an error not his own.</p>

<p>This was all the more unjust because <i>Punch</i> was
both able and willing to discriminate between the
level-headed men of the North and the jingoes,
as this extract will show.</p>

<p class="center">OUR DEAR BROTHER JONATHAN</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This delightful ebullition of fervent brotherly love has
most fittingly appeared in a Philadelphia paper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It may be, in view of all these grave considerations and
the sad necessities of the case, that, in order to avoid a war
which could only end in our discomfiture, the Administration
may be compelled to concede the demands of England,
and perhaps release <span class="smcap">Messrs. Mason</span> and <span class="smcap">Slidell</span>. God
forbid!&mdash;but in a crisis like this we must adapt ourselves to
stern circumstances, and yield every feeling of pride to maintain
our existence. If this contingency should ever arise&mdash;and
I am only speculating upon a disagreeable possibility&mdash;then
let us swear, not only to ourselves but our children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n44">[44]</a></span>
who come after us, to repay this greedy, insolent, and cowardly
Power with the retribution of a just and fearful vengeance.
If England in our time of distress makes herself our foe, and
offers to be our assassin, we will treat her as a foe when we
can do so untrammeled and unmenaced by another enemy."</p>

<p>"Greedy, insolent, and cowardly," these are nice fraternal
terms; and what a truly loving spirit is evinced by swearing
"fearful vengeance" upon the "assassin," and handing
to posterity the keeping of the oath!</p>

<p>No whit less affectionate in feeling is what follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we do concede the demands of England, however, it
will only be because we desire to crush this rebellion, as a
duty we owe to mankind. It will be because we prefer to
master the great evil, and do not wish to be alienated from
our duty by an international and comparatively unimportant
quarrel; it will be because we prefer national salvation to
the gratification of any feeling of national pride. It will be
a great act of self-denial. But when we come from this rebellion
it will be with a magnificent army, educated and organised,
and with the sense of this wrong weighing upon
them. It will be with a navy competent to meet any navy
upon the globe. It will be for us then to remember how
England was our enemy in the day of our misfortune, and
to make that remembrance a dark and fearful page of her
history, and an eternal memory of our own."</p>

<p>That these are the opinions of most people in America
nobody on this side of the Atlantic will believe. But that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n46">[46]</a></span>
there are roughs and rowdies in the States, who as they have
nothing they can lose by war are always full of bluster and
warlike in their talk, this may any one in England very easily
conceive. Of course it is to please them that such stuff as we
have quoted is stuck in Yankee newspapers; and our sole
surprise is that the journals which admit it find it pays them
so to do. The rowdies as a rule are not overflushed with
wealth and can ill afford to spend their coppers upon literature,
which, the chances are, they scarcely would know
how to read.</p>
</div>

<p>For the benefit of the American jingoes <i>Punch</i>
on December 7th, issued the following warning,
with an appropriate cartoon:</p>

<p class="center">A WARNING TO JONATHAN;</p>

<p class="center">OR, "DOTH HE WAG HIS TAIL?"</p>

<div style="margin-left: 15%;">

<p><span class="smcap">Jonathan</span>, <span class="smcap">Jonathan</span>, 'ware of the Lion:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's patient, he's placable, slow to take fire:<br />
There are tricks which in safety a puppy might try on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from dogs of his <i>own</i> size they waken his ire.</p>

<p>With your bounce and your bunkum you've pelted him often,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good humoured he laughed as the missiles flew by,<br />
Hard words you've employed, which he ne'er bid you soften,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As knowing your tallest of talk all my eye.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n48">[48]</a></span>

<p>When you blustered he still was content with pooh-poohing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you flared up he just let the shavings burn out:<br />
He knew you were fonder of talking than doing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lions for trifles don't put themselves out.</p>

<p>But beware how you tempt even leonine patience,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or presume the old strength has forsaken his paw:<br />
He's proud to admit you and he are relations,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even relations may take too much law.</p>

<p>If there's one thing he values, 'tis right of asylum;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe who rests 'neath the guard of the Lion must be:<br />
In that shelter the hard-hunted fugitive whilome<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must be able to sleep the deep sleep of the free.</p>

<p>Then think twice, and think well, ere from guard of the Lion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who seek his protection you try to withdraw:<br />
Though <span class="smcap">Stowell</span> and <span class="smcap">Wheaten</span> and <span class="smcap">Kent</span> you rely on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are points on which Lions won't listen to jaw.</p>

<p>Remember in time the old tale of the showman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who his head in the mouth of the Lion would sheath,<br />
Till with lengthened impunity, bold as a Roman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed to forget that the Lion had teeth.</p>

<p>But the time came at last, when all risks madly scorning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went just too far down that road rough and red,<br />
When, with only one wag of his tail for a warning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snap went Leo's jaws, and off went <span class="smcap">Barnum's</span> head!</p>
</div>

<p>This was followed up on December 14th, with one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n50">[50]</a></span>
of Tenniel's finest cartoons, that entitled "Waiting
for an Answer."</p>

<p>Two amusing bits of doggerel appeared in the
same number, one representing the British nation's
view of the international episode.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. DURDEN ON THE AMERICAN DIFFICULTY</p>

<div style="margin-left: 10%; ">

<p>"Them there nasty good-for-nothing Yankees!" cried old <span class="smcap">Mrs. Durden</span>,<br />
"Worrits me to that degree, it makes my life almost a burden.<br />
Board our mail and seize our passengers, the ribbles! Goodness, gracious!<br />
Like their imperence to be sure; 'tis that what makes 'em so owdacious.<br />
<br />
"What next now I wonder, Captain?" Answer <span class="smcap">Captain Skipper</span> made,<br />
"Well Ma'am, our next move, I fancy, will be breaking their blockade."<br />
"Blockhead! Ah!" exclaimed the lady. "Truer word was never spoken.<br />
Drat the blockheads, all says I; may every head on 'em be broken!"</p>
</div>

<p>The other is a bit of broad fun, in mockery of
the profuse volumes of smoke and sound which
were emitted by Yankee fire-eaters.

<p class="center">A VOICE FROM WASHINGTON</p>

<p>The manly and tactful apology which represented
the feeling of the better sort of folk in America,
and which was wrung from a reluctant
cabinet by Abraham Lincoln, softened for a moment
the asperity of our old antagonist. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n56">[56]</a></span>
following rather amiable verses were written in
anticipation of the amicable settlement which
already (January 11, 1862), seemed probable:</p>

<p class="center">A FAIR OFFER FROM JOHN BULL TO MISS COLUMBIA</p>

<div style="margin-left: 15%">

<p>Shall we kiss and be friends? Why not? Sister <span class="smcap">Columbia</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more ugly faces let you and me pull;<br />
Though we both have our tempers, our worries and troubles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let "bygones be bygones" for me, says <span class="smcap">John Bull</span>.</p>

<p>You must own that you've given me a deal of bad language,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have been far too free with your bunkum and brag;<br />
<i>That</i> I'll pocket, if now, like a sensible woman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll disclaim your friend <span class="smcap">Wilkes</span>, and salute the old flag.</p>

<p>Fools may sneer and call family feelings all humbug,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I feel that one blood in the veins of us flows:<br />
Our tongues are the same, though I don't like your fashion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of talking, (as you'd make <i>me</i> pay) through the nose.</p>

<p>We snarled and we scratched, in the days of our folly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you wanted to leave me and start for yourself;<br />
To think of those times makes me quite melancholy&mdash;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood that we wasted&mdash;&mdash;the temper and pelf!</p>

<p>When I vowed that I'd tame you, and make you knock under,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you dared me and bit, like a vixen as well;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n58">[58]</a></span>
I did think by this time we had both seen our blunder;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meant to live as good friends and in peace buy and sell.</p>

<p>But of late I can't think what the deuce has come o'er you:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, you turn your own house out of window, and then,<br />
Declare that <i>I</i> want to o'erreach you and floor you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop my ships, seize my passengers, bully my men!</p>

<p>I can stand a great deal from my own blood-relations,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I know that your troubles your temper have soured;<br />

<p>Yet Lincoln, the peacemaker of the occasion,
got little credit from <i>Punch</i>, which, indeed, began
now to pursue him with unremitting invective.</p>

<p>The gorilla-like caricature of Lincoln's features
makes its first appearance in a cartoon wherein
this repulsive face is joined to a raccoon's
body.</p>

<p>The "coon" is shown up a tree, Colonel Bull,
standing below, has drawn a bead on him with his
gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="n60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Air you in earnest, Colonel?" asks the
coon.</p>

<p>"I am," replies the mighty Bull.</p>

<p>"Don't fire," says the coon, "I'll come
down."</p>

<p>Even Lincoln's proclamation emancipating the
slaves in the seceding states did not soften the
asperity of the old-time anti-slavery advocate.
<i>Punch</i> feigned to see in this message only the
ruse of a wily combatant driven to a last resource.
This idea is put into a quatrain, as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The American Chess-Players</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 25%">Although of conquest Yankee North despairs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brain for some expedient wild he racks,<br />
And thinks that having failed on the white squares,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't do worse by moving on the Blacks.</p>

<p>Under the heading "One Good Turn Deserves
Another," Old Abe is shown extending musket,
sword and knapsack to a negro who refuses to be
cajoled by his honeyed words.</p>

<p>"Why I do declare," says Abe, "it's my dear old
friend, Sambo! Course you'll fight for us, Sambo.
Lend us a hand, old hoss, do."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="n62">[62]</a></span>
The same jibe finds vent in the following
poems:</p>

<p class="center">ABE'S LAST CARD; OR, ROUGE-ET-NOIR</p>

<p>In September, 1862, the two combatants are
represented as sinking exhausted into the arms of
negro backers, who are vainly attempting to put
them on their feet. In the background stands a
self-important eagle arrayed in the Napoleonic
uniform and a biped lion dressed in a sack coat
and an air of conscious superiority.</p>

<p>Says the eagle to the lion, "Don't you think we
ought to fetch the police?"</p>

<p>The legend under the cartoon runs, "Not Up
to Time, or Interference Would Be Very Welcome."</p>

<p>In the following January comes a well imagined
cartoon entitled "The Latest From Spirit Land,"
showing the bluff and kindly ghost of George III
trying to enter into conversation with the stiffly
stupid ghost of Mr. Washington. "Well, Mr.
Washington," says George, "what do you think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n66">[66]</a></span>
of your fine republic now, eh? What d'ye think?
What d'ye think, eh?" To which Mr. Washington
retorts with an inarticulate "Humph!"</p>

<p>In May of 1863 a cartoon entitled "The Great
Cannon Game" shows Abe Lincoln playing billiards
with Jeff Davis. It is the latter's shot.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Charleston!" he cries; "that's
another to me."</p>

<p>Abe Lincoln mutters in an aside, "Darned if he
ain't scored ag'in! I wish I could make a few
winning hazards for a change."</p>

<p>An accompanying article entitled "The Great
American Billiard Match" is amusing enough
when read to-day in the light of the great "winning
hazards" that were to be made by Abe within less
than sixty days.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>"Considerable excitement," it runs, "has been caused in
sporting circles by this long protracted match, which, owing
to the style of play adopted by the parties, appears to make
but very little progress toward a finish. The largeness of
the stakes depending on the contest might be supposed to
make the players careful in their strokes, but few expected
that the game would last so long as it has done, and no one
now dare prophesy when it will be finished. It having been
resolved to play the cannon game, some anxiety at first was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n68">[68]</a></span>
not unreasonably felt among the backers of Jeff Davis,
the crack player for the South; but the knowing ones, who
knew their man, made no attempt to hedge, notwithstanding
what was said about his being out of play and, in the cannon
game especially, somewhat overmatched. It is needless to
remark here that the first strokes which he made quite
justified their confidence, and, indeed, throughout the game
he has done nothing yet to shake it, so that if he have but a
fair amount of luck, his backers feel assured that he won't
easily be beaten, and an extra fluke or two might make
him win the match.</p>

<p>"As for old Abe Lincoln, the champion player of the
North, his backers, we believe, are as confident as ever that
he is the best man, although at times his play has not appeared
to prove it. There is no doubt that he has more strength
at his command, but strength is of small use without knowing
how to use it. Abe Lincoln may have skill, but he has
not yet shown much of it; and certainly he more than once
has shown himself outgeneralled. His backers say he purposely
is playing a slow game, just to draw out his opponent
and see what he can do. In ninety days, they say, he is
cocksure of a victory, but this is an old boast, and nobody
except themselves now places any faith in it. Abe's famous
Bull Run stroke was a bad start to begin with, and his
Charleston break has ended in his having to screw back,
and thus slip into balk to save himself from mischief.</p>

<p>How the game will end we won't pretend to prophesy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n70">[70]</a></span>
There are plenty of good judges, who still appear inclined
to bet in favor of the South and longish odds are offered
that the game will be a drawn one. Abe's attempt to pot
the niggers some put down as a foul stroke, but whether
foul or not, it added little to his score. Upon the whole
we think his play has not been much admired, although his
backers have been vehement in superlatively praising it.
There is more sympathy for the South, as being the weaker
side&mdash;a fact which Jeff's supporters indignantly deny, and
which certainly the North has not done much as yet toward
proving. Without ourselves inclining one way or the other,
we may express a neutral hope that the best player may win;
and we certainly shall echo the desire of all who watch the
game if we add that the sooner it is now played out the
better."</p>
</div>

<p>The boasted "neutrality" was put to a rather
severe test when, in less than "ninety days," the
victory of which Abe's backers were "cock sure"
proved a double barrelled one at Vicksburg, in
Mississippi, and at Gettysburg, in Pennsylvania.
The news of these tremendous events set all the
Federal States of America shouting with triumph
on the succeeding Fourth of July. There were no
international cables in those days. Consequently
it was not until two weeks later that the news
reached England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="n72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>In the interim, on that very July 4, certain
Northern Americans in London, all unconscious of
what had happened, celebrated their national
anniversary almost in earshot of the <i>Punch</i> office
to the great disgust of the gentlemen on its
staff.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>"There is something peculiarly graceful," [snarls Punch
in the issue for July 18th], "in celebrating Independence
Day in London. 'The Britishers whipped all the world
and we whipped the Britishers,' used to be the established
formula of Yankee self-glorification. It is the Yankees'
belief that they accomplished their secession from England
by simple conquest; triumphant superiority in arms. To
hold the anniversary of successful insurrection, not to say
rebellion, in the very den of the British lion, treading on
his tail and gently poking him with a playful boot tip, is to
compliment that noble animal with credit for some magnanimity.
The British residents in Paris would hardly
have the confiding generosity and the taste in like manner to
celebrate the return day of the Battle of Waterloo in the
French capital.</p>

<p>"We pause here to ask whether the Confederates do not,
as they reasonably may, repeat the Yankee boast above
quoted with brag additional? Have they not begun to say,
'The Britishers whipped all the world, the Yankees whipped
the Britishers and we whipped the Yankees'? Not yet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n74">[74]</a></span>
perhaps. Averse to indulgence in premature exultation,
they may reserve that saying for Independence Day No. 2."</p>
</div>

<p>In conclusion <i>Punch</i> makes this comment on
the fact that in honor of the anniversary the flag
of the United States had been hoisted on the summit
of certain buildings, "Shouldn't it have been hoisted
halfmast high?"</p>

<p>The answer came in the form of a thunderous
negative with the next mail from America.</p>

<p>Thereafter <i>Punch</i> lost his supreme interest in
the great Civil War. He made no allusions to
Gettysburg or to Vicksburg. The "neutral hope"
was painfully dampened by Northern triumphs.
His commercial sympathy was all with the losing
side. The wish was father to the not very neutral
thought that the negro might prove the undoing
of his Northern allies. On August 15 appeared a
cartoon entitled "Brutus and Cæsar, from the
American Edition of Shakespeare." To the tent
of Brutus (Lincoln) enters at night the ghost of
Cæsar, a black spectre. This colloquy occurs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Brutus&mdash;Wall, now, do tell! Who's you?</p>

<p>Cæsar&mdash;I am dy ebil genius, massa <span class="smcap"> Linking</span>. Dis child
am awful Inimpressional.</p>
</div>

<p>In October appeared a cartoon headed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n76">[76]</a></span>
unconscious satire, "John Bull's Neutrality."
John Bull standing with his arms akimbo in the
doorway of his shop is glaring defiantly at two
bad boys, clad respectively in federal and in confederate
uniforms, who slink away before his
glance and drop the stones they were preparing
to hurl at his windows.</p>

<p>"Look here, boys," says John, "I don't care
twopence for your noise, but if you throw stones
at my windows I must thrash you both."</p>

<p>The same moral is enforced in the following
poem:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">MR. BULL TO HIS AMERICAN BULLIES</p>

<div style="margin-left: 30%">

<p>Hoy, I say you two there, kicking<br />

<p>In a succeeding cartoon <i>Punch</i> called for a
separation between the fighters, for now, said he,
"dis-union is strength." Another cartoon hails
the fraternization&mdash;reported to have taken place
between negroes bearing the flags of the rival
armies&mdash;with the epigram "When black meets
black then comes the end of war."

<p>Henry Ward Beecher's visit to England, in
the autumn of 1863, is celebrated by a cartoon
and by a poem in which due praise is given to the
vigor of his oratory and to the excellence of his
intentions.</p>

<p class="center">BRITISHER TO BEECHER</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20%">

<p>Alas! what a pity it is, <span class="smcap">Parson Beecher</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you came not at once when Secession broke out,<br />
As <span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln's</span> Apostle, a preacher<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Union; a gospel which Englishmen doubt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that Union, you see,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a limb of our tree:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its own branches to break themselves off are as free.</p>

<p>Still, <span class="smcap">Beecher</span>, if you had been only sent hither,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When at first the Palmetto flag flouted the sky,<br />
Commissioned foul slavery's faction to wither,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this nation invoke to be Freedom's ally,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your eloquent art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had won England's heart;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were fully disposed towards taking your part.</p>

<p>Instead of a Reverend <span class="smcap">Beecher</span>, appealing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To our conscience, in Liberty's name, for the right,<br />
We heard a cool scoundrel advise in the stealing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of <span class="smcap">Britannia's</span> domains, North and South to unite;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your papers were full<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst he bore the blockade which withheld cotton wool.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n82">[82]</a></span>

<p>Malevolence, taking our ill-will for granted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has reviled us, pursued us with bluster and threat,<br />
Supposing itself the remembrance had planted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our bosom of wrongs which we couldn't forget,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And should take, in its case<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of misfortune, as base<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A revenge as itself would have ta'en in our place.</p>

<p>Tirades against England, with menace of slaughter,<br />

Your bards talk of blowing us out of the water,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And threaten to "punish <span class="smcap">John Bull</span> at his door."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this isn't the way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make Englishmen pray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Yankees may finish by gaining the day.</p>

<p>An afterthought only is "Justice to Niggers;"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis a cry which those Yankees raised not till they found<br />
That they for a long time had been pulling triggers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At their slaveholding brothers, and gained little ground.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First <span class="smcap">Abe Lincoln</span> gave out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he'd fain bring about,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Re-union with slavery too, or without.</p>

<p>So don't waste your words in attempts at persuasion,<br />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="n84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Later, <i>Punch</i> published this:</p>

<p class="center">ADIEU TO MR. BEECHER</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Beecher</span> has left us; he has sailed for America,
where he can tell his congregation just what he likes, but
where he will, we are sure, tell <span class="smcap">Messrs. Lincoln</span> and <span class="smcap">Seward</span>
the exact truth, namely that large numbers of the uneducated
classes crowded to hear a celebrated orator, and
that the press has been very good-natured to him. Also,
we hope he will say, because he knows it, that the educated
classes are at the present date just as Neutral in the matter
of the American quarrel as they were before the reverend
gentleman's arrival. Having duly stated these facts to the
<span class="smcap">President</span> and the Minister, <span class="smcap">Mr. Beecher</span> may put them
in any form he pleases before the delightful congregation,
whose members pay £40 a-year, each, for pews. And to
show that we part with him in all good nature, we immortalise
his witty allusion to ourselves in his farewell speech:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know my friend <i>Punch</i> thinks I have been serving out
'soothing syrup' to the British Lion. (<i>Laughter.</i>) Very
properly the picture represents me as putting a spoon into
the lion's ear instead of his mouth; and I don't wonder that
the great brute turns away very sternly from that plan of
feeding." (<i>Renewed Laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>A gentler criticism upon us could not be, and we scorn to
retort that, having a respect for anatomy, we did not make
the lion's ear large enough to hold the other spoon depicted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n86">[86]</a></span>
in that magnificent engraving. For the <span class="smcap">Reverend Beecher</span>
is not a spoon, whatever we may think of his audiences in
England. And so we wish him good-bye, and plenty of
greenbacks and green believers.</p>
</div>

<p>The re-election of Abraham Lincoln, in November,
1864, called forth a grotesque and unpleasant
caricature of Lincoln as the "Federal Ph&oelig;nix."
It was accompanied by these verses:</p>

<p class="center">THE FEDERAL PH&OElig;NIX</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20%">

<p>When <span class="smcap">Herodotus</span>, surnamed "The Father of History"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(We are not informed who was History's mother),<br />
Went a travelling to Egypt, that region of mystery,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where each step presented some marvel or other,</p>

<p>In a great city there, called (in Greek) Heliopolis,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests put him up to a strange story&mdash;rather&mdash;<br />
Of a bird, who came up to that priestly metropolis,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in five hundred years, to inter its own father.</p>

<p>When to filial feeling apparently callous,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a plume ruffled (as <i>we</i> should say, not a hair rent),<br />
In a <i>pot-pourri</i> made of sweet-spice, myrrh, and aloes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flagrantly, burnt, after burying, his parent.</p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Pomponius Mela</span> has managed to gather<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="n88">[88]</a></span>
This bird has oft figured in emblems and prophecies&mdash;<br />

</div>

<p>On December 10th, <i>Punch</i> published this brutal
burlesque anticipation of that noble speech made
by President Lincoln at his second Inauguration,
which has now taken its due rank among
the great masterpieces of forensic English:</p>

<p class="center">PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S INAUGURAL SPEECH</p>

<p class="center"><i>(By Ultramarine Telegraph)</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Well</span>, we've done it, gentlemen. Bully for us. Cowhided
the Copperheads considerable. <i>Non nobis</i>, of course, but
still I reckon we have had a hand in the glory, some. That
reminds me of the Old World story about the Hand of Glory,
which I take to have been the limb of a gentleman who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n90">[90]</a></span>
been justified on the gallows, and which the witches turned
into a patent moderator lamp, as would lead a burglar safe
into any domicile which he might wish to plunder. We ain't
burglars, quite t'other, but I fancy that if <span class="smcap">Uly Grant</span> could
get hold of that kind and description of thing to help him into
Richmond, he'd not be so un-Christian proud as to refuse the
hand of a malefactor. (<i>Right, right!</i>) Well, right or left
hand, that's no odds, gentlemen. (<i>Laughter.</i>) Now I am
sovereign of the sovereign people of this great and united
republic for four years next ensuing the date hereof, as I
used to say when I was a lawyer. (<i>You are! Bully for you!</i>)
Yes, gentlemen, but you must do something more than bully
for me, you must fight for me, if you please, and whether you
please or not. As the old joke says, there's no compulsion,
only you must. Must is for the King, they say in the rotten
Old world. Well, I'm King, and you shall be Viceroys over
me. But I tell you again, and in fact I repeat it, that there's
man's work to do to beat these rebels. They <i>may</i> run away,
no doubt. As the Irishman says, pigs may fly, but they're
darned onlikely birds to do it. They must be well whipped,
gentlemen, and I must trouble you for the whipcord. (<i>You
shall have it!</i>) Rebellion is a wicked thing, gentlemen, an
awful wicked thing, and the mere nomenclating thereof
would make my hair stand on end, if it could be more standonender
than it is. (<i>Laughter.</i>) Truly awful, that is when
it is performed against mild, free, constitutional sway like
that of the White House, but of course right and glorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n92">[92]</a></span>
when perpetrated against ferocious, cruel, bloodthirsty old
tyrants like <span class="smcap">George the Third</span>. We must punish these
rebels for their own good, and to teach them the blessings of
this mighty and transcendental Union. (<i>We will, we will!</i>) All
very tall talking, gentlemen, but talking won't take Richmond.
If it would, and there had been six Richmonds in the field,
we should long since have took them all. If Richmond would
fall like Jericho, by every man blowing of his own trumpet,
we've brass enough in our band for that little feat in acoustics.
But when a cow sticks, as <span class="smcap">Grant</span> does, in the mud,
how then? (<i>Great laughter.</i>) Incontestably, gentlemen,
this great and mighty nation must give her a shove on. Shove
for Richmond, gentlemen. (<i>That's the talk!</i>) Now about
these eternal blacks, you expect me to say something touching
them, though I suppose we're none of us too fond of
touching them, for reasons in that case made and provided,
as I used to say. Well, listen. We've got them on our
hands, that's a fact, and it reminds me of a nigger story.
Two of these blacks met, and one had a fine new hat.
"Where you got dat hat, <span class="smcap">Sambo</span>?" says t'other. "Out ob
a shop, nigger," says <span class="smcap">Sambo</span>. "'Spex so," says t'other, "and
what might be the price ob dat hat?" "Can't say, zactly,
nigger, the shopkeeper didn't happen to be on the premises."
(<i>Laughter.</i>) Well, we've got the niggers, and I can't exactly
say&mdash;or at least I don't think you'd like to hear&mdash;what might
be the price of those articles. But we must utilise our hats,
gentlemen. We must make them dig and fight, that's a fact.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n94">[94]</a></span>
There's no shame in digging, I suppose. Adam digged, and he
is a gentleman of older line than any of the bloated and slavish
aristocracies of Europe. And as for fighting, they must feel
honoured at doing that for the glorious old flag that has braved
for eighty-nine years and a-half, be the same little more or
less, the battle and the breeze. (<i>Cheers.</i>) Yes, and when
the rebellion's put down, we'll see what's to be done with
them. Perhaps if the naughty boys down South get uncommon
contrite hearts, we may make them a little present
of the blacks, not as slaves, of course, but as legal apprentices
with undefined salaries determinable on misconduct.
(<i>Cheers.</i>) Meantime, gentlemen, I won't deny that the
niggers are useful in the way of moral support. They give
this here war a holy character, and we can call it a crusade
for freedom. A man may call his house an island if he likes,
as has been said by one of those fiendish British writers who
abuse our hospitality by not cracking us up. (<i>War with
England!</i>) Well, all in good time, gentlemen. Let our
generals learn their business first. I don't blame them,
mind you, that they haven't learned it yet, for when a man
has kept a whiskey-store, or a bar, or an oyster-cellar, or an
old-clothes' shop for years, he can't be expected, merely
because he puts on a uniform, to become a Hannibal or a
Napoleon, or even a Marlborough or a Wellington. Likewise,
they must learn to keep reasonable sober. Friends at
a distance will please accept this intimation. (<i>Roars of
Laughter.</i>) When that's done, and the rebels are whipped,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n96">[96]</a></span>
and we are in want of more fighting, we'll see whether Richmond
in England, where the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> palace of Windsor
Castle is situate lying and being, is a harder nut to crack than
Richmond nearer us. (<i>Cheers.</i>) Gentlemen, one thing
more. Did you ever hear the story of the farmer who had
been insulted by an exciseman? "He wur so rude," said
the farmer, "that I wur obliged to remonstrate with him."
"And to what effect did you remonstrate?" asked a friend.
"Well I don't know about effect, but I bent the poker so that
I was obliged to get a hammer to straighten it." Gentlemen,
we must straighten this glorious Union, and the hammer is
taxes. (<i>Laughter.</i>) You may laugh, but you must pay.
I don't mean to be hard upon this mighty nation, and our
friend <span class="smcap">Mr. Cobden</span> (<i>cheers</i>) has already indirectly informed
the besotted masses of British slaves that we intend to repudiate
our greenbacks, except to the amount they may be
worth in the market when redeemed. But the poker wants
a deal of hammering, nevertheless, and you must pay up.
You'll hear more about this from a friend of mine in the
Government, so I only give you the hint, as the man said
when he kicked his uncle down-stairs. (<i>Laughter.</i>) I
believe that's about all I had to say, and this almighty Union
will be conserved to shine through the countless ages an
ineffable beacon and symbol of blessed and everlasting light
and glory if you will only mind the proverb of Sancho Panza,
which says, "Pray to God devoutly, and hammer on stoutly."

<p>On April 15, 1865, came a cartoon, a really
superb one, which is sometimes reckoned Tenniel's
masterpiece, entitled "Habet!" It represents the
combatants as gladiators before the enthroned and
imperial negroes ("Ave Cæsar!").</p>

<p>But in sentiment at least a nobler was to come,
the affecting picture of Britannia's tribute and
<i>Punch's</i> amende, called simply "Abraham Lincoln,
foully assassinated April 14, 1865."</p>

<p>The accompanying verses, by Tom Taylor, not,
as has sometimes been asserted, by Shirley
Brooks, were a complete recantation for former
misunderstanding and wrongdoing. They will
bear quoting again:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<p class="center"><i>Foully Assassinated April, 14, 1865</i></p>

<div style="margin-left: 25%">

<p>You lay a wreath on murdered Lincoln's bier,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, who with mocking pencil wont to trace<br />
Broad for the self-complacent British sneer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His length of shambling limb, his furrowed face,</p>

<p>His gaunt, gnarled hands, his unkempt, bristling hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His garb uncouth, his bearing ill at ease;<br />
His lack of all we prize as debonair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of power or will to shine, of art to please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="n100">[100]</a></span>
You, whose smart pen backed up the pencil's laugh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging each step, as though the way were plain;<br />
Reckless, so it could point its paragraph<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of chief's perplexity or people's pain.</p>

<p>Beside this corps, that beats for winding sheet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stars and Stripes he lived to rear anew,<br />
Between the mourners at his head and feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, scurril-jester, is there room for you?</p>

<p>Yes, he had lived to shame me from my sneer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lame my pencil, and confute my pen&mdash;<br />
To make me own this hind of princes peer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rail-splitter a true-born king of men.</p>

<p>My shallow judgment I had learnt to rue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noting how to occasion's height he rose,<br />
How his quaint wit made home-truth seem more true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, iron-like, his temper grew by blows.</p>

<p>How humble yet how hopeful he could be;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How in good fortune and in ill the same;<br />
Nor bitter in success, nor boastful he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirsty for gold, nor feverish for fame.</p>

<p>He went about his work&mdash;such work as few<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever had laid on head and heart and hand&mdash;<br />
As one who knows where there's a task to do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man's honest will must heaven's good grace command:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="n102">[102]</a></span>
Who trusts the strength will with the burden grow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That God makes instruments to work his will,<br />
If but that will we can arrive to know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor tamper with the weights of good and ill.</p>

<p>So he went forth to battle on the side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he felt clear was liberty's and right's,<br />
As in his peasant boyhood he had plied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His warfare with rude nature's thwarting mights&mdash;</p>

<p>The uncleared forest, the unbroken soil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron back, that turns the lumberer's axe;<br />
The rapid, that o'erbears the boatman's toil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prairie, hiding the mazed wanderer's tracks,</p>

<p>The ambushed Indian, and the prowling bear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such were the needs that helped his youth to train:<br />
Rough culture&mdash;but such trees large fruit may bear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If but their stocks be of right girth and grain.</p>

<p>So he grew up, a destined work to do,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n104">[104]</a></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lived to do it; four long-suffering years'<br />
Ill-fate, ill-feeling, ill-report lived through,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he heard the hisses change to cheers,</p>

<p>The taunts to tribute, the abuse to praise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took both with the same unwavering mood:<br />
Till, as he came on light from darkling days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seemed to touch the goal from where he stood,</p>

<p>A felon hand, between the goal and him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reached from behind his back, a trigger prest&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n108">[108]</a></span>
And those perplexed and patient eyes were dim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those gaunt, long-laboring limbs were laid to rest.</p>

<p>The words of mercy were upon his lips,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgiveness in his heart and on his pen,<br />
When this vile murderer brought swift eclipse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thoughts of peace on earth, good will to men.</p>

<p>The Old World and the New, from sea to sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utter one voice of sympathy and shame!<br />
Sore heart, so stopped when it at last beat high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad life, cut short just as its triumph came.</p>

<p>A deed accurst! Strokes have been struck before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the assassin's hand, whereof men doubt<br />
If more of horror or disgrace they bore;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thy foul crime, like Cain's, stands darkly out.</p>

<p>Vile hand, that brandest murder on a strife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whate'er its grounds, stoutly and nobly striven;<br />
And with the martyr's crown crownest a life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With much to praise, little to be forgiven!</p>
</div>

<p>From that time forward <i>Punch</i> took seriously
to heart the lesson he had taught himself, and his
relations with Brother Jonathan were thereafter
of a very different and a far more cordial kind.
of a very different and a far more cordial kind.</p>

<p>That these verses made a profound impression
in the United States is undoubted. It has even
been opined that they were largely instrumental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="n113">[113]</a></span>
in preventing an imminent war between Great
Britain and the United States.</p>

<p>Perhaps the effect would have been less if we
on this side had known how grudgingly the amende
was offered. Mr. A. H. Layard in his recent
"Life of Shirley Brooks" has invited us to take
a peep behind the <i>Punch</i> curtain. He shows
that the editorial staff of the paper was divided
in the matter, Shirley Brooks leading the opposition
against the publication of the poem. In Brooks'
diary Mr. Layard discovered the following entry:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dined <i>Punch</i>. All there. Let out my views
against some verses on Lincoln in which T. T.
(Tom Taylor) had not only made P. eat humble
pie, but swallow dish and all."</p>

Transcriber's Note.<br />
(1) Spelling, punctuation and typographical errors have been corrected,<br />
with the exception of those which occur in the illustrations and text<br />
copied directly from "Punch".<br />
(2) The book titles on images 4 and 8 have been removed as unnecessary<br />
duplications.<br />
(3) Most of the 49 pages of text consist of lengthy paragraphs, blockquotes<br />
and poems. Only a small proportion relate to specific adjacent cartoons,<br />
which are nearly all in chronological order, full-size on alternate pages of the<br />
book. As a result of these two factors, normal HTML-version procedures<br />
created an unacceptably uncomfortable read, often breaking with only a few<br />
lines of text between two screen-width illustrations, completely irrelevant<br />
to the nearby text. It was therefore decided to move all the cartoons to the<br />
end of the book, with links to the List of Illustrations.<br />
(4) Resulting from the decision in (3), the page numbers in the List of<br />
Illustrations coincide with the restructured format, not with the original book.

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
